# Psychic-Game
This is a guessing game. 
You're goal is to guess the random letter the computer has chosen.
capitalization doesn't matter as the code translates uppercase guesses into lower case.
You have 9 guesses each round to get the correct letter. If you guess correctly within the 9 guesses you gain a win.
If you do not guess correctly with the 9 chances you are given then you gain a loss.
